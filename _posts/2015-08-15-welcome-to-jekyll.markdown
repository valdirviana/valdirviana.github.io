## Introdução
You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

{% highlight css %}
.minha-imagem {
    -webkit-filter: grayscale(100%); // suporte Chrome, Safari, Android, Opera
            filter: grayscale(100%); // suporte para Firefox
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### UM

{% highlight c# %}
public void aqui(){}
}
{% endhighlight %}
